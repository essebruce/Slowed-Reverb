# Slowed-Reverb
A repo to document the creation of my Slowed + Reverb tool!

Currently this is a command line tool, and hopefully I can build this out to be a fully fledged website in the near future.
Original Work in Progress files can be found in the version-1 branch. Will be adding information about needed dependencies and functionality very soon.
